Consider Python packages like Scikit-learn, pandas, and NumPy. These are all Python packages built with object-oriented programming.

OOP
Objects have characteristics (attributes) and actions (methods)

Class: A blueprint consisting of methods and attributes.
Object: An instance of a class.
Attribute: A descriptor or characteristic.
Method: An action that a class or object could take.
Encapsulation: One of the fundamental ideas behind object-oriented programming:
you can combine functions and data all into a single entity, called a class.
Encapsulation allows you to hide implementation details, much like how the scikit-learn package hides the implementation of machine learning algorithms.


A function and a method look very similar. They both use the def keyword.
They also have inputs and return outputs. The difference is that a method is inside of a class whereas a function is outside of a class.
