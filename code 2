Problems that could occur in data science arenâ€™t always easily detectable; 
you might have values being encoded incorrectly, features being used inappropriately, or unexpected data breaking assumptions.

Testing
In an industry setting, before deploying.
(Test Driven Development (TDD) - write tests before developing code to implement tasks)
https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/tests/

Unit test - small block of code, usually a function
isolated from the rest of your program, and thus, no dependencies are involved. They don't require access to databases, APIs, or other external sources of information.
To install pytest, run pip install -U pytest in your terminal.
Create a test file starting with test_.
Define unit test functions that start with test_ inside the test file.
Enter pytest into your terminal in the directory of your test file and it detects these tests for you.

Assert Statement

To show that all the parts of our program work with each other properly, communicating and transferring data between them correctly, we use integration tests.


Logging - the process of recording messages to describe events that have occurred while running your software
Appropriate level for logging
Debug: Use this level for anything that happens in the program. 
Error: Use this level to record any error that occurs. 
Info: Use this level to record all actions that are user driven or system specific, such as regularly scheduled operations.


Code Reviews
Catch errors, ensure readability, check standards are met, share knowledge
e.g. Are there loops or other steps I can vectorize?

Tip: Use a code linter - automatically check for coding standards and PEP 8 guidelines
